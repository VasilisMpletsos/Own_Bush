WELCOME TO THE VMpletsos BUSH!

Lets start on the basics how this bush works!
For start you have to know some commands i guess :P !!!!

Ok follow me:

For start you just can press a single command like ls -la or pwd or whatever you wish and the bush will execute it;

But lets do something more cool! In this bush if you type multiple command seperated by ; it will execute all this commands together!
Example: ls -la ; pwd ; ls ; ls -a

Of course we would like to have any wrong command that if didnt had executed would have destoyed the program so we add an excellet feture!
From now on you can type multiple commands seperated by && in order to execute every command only if the previous was succesfull!
Example: ls -la && pwd && ls && ls -a

So this is my VMpletsos bush and i hope you will love it!

Now some notes:
1.It can support up to 10 multiple commands seperated by ; or && because we wouldnt like to have a long command line like a Texas road!
(Feel free to change that in more commands if u like only by changing row 25 char *individualCommands[WHAT EVER YOU LIKE];
2.You can Run batch files Only by typing ./OwnBush File_You_Want_To_Execute.txt (Be carefull to use txt file format).
3.If you have typed anything wrong in a sentence with multiple commands seperated by && it will throw you to type again that command because everyone deserves a second chance!
4.We support up to 512 characters in a straight line for you to type in!
5.Play fair and square , dont use this bush for illegal purposes like hacking!
6.In order to use this pprogram first type make in the command line , for the rest the makefile is responsible!

Thanks for reading , i hope you like it and learn a lots of things using it!
